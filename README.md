## Title: Diabetes Database - Exploratory Analysis

This analysis examines a comprehensive dataset of 768 patients with diabetes, providing critical insights into diabetes risk factors and their relationships. The dashboard presents a multi-dimensional view of how age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels interact to influence diabetes outcomes, providing valuable insights for healthcare decision-making.

#### Key Findings
1. Disease Prevalence & Demographics
34.9% diabetes prevalence (268 out of 768 patients) - significantly higher than the global average of ~11%
Average patient age: 33.2 years - indicating this dataset captures diabetes in relatively young populations
High-risk glucose levels: Average glucose of 120.9 mg/dL approaches pre-diabetic thresholds

2. Age-Related Glucose Patterns
The glucose-by-age trend reveals fascinating insights:
Glucose levels fluctuate significantly across age groups, with notable spikes in the 40-60 age range
Younger patients (20-30) show high variability, suggesting diabetes can manifest early with aggressive patterns
Peak risk periods appear around ages 45-55, where glucose levels consistently exceed 140 mg/dL

3. Blood Pressure Risk Stratification
Blood pressure analysis reveals a clear diabetes risk progression:
Hypertensive patients (>100 mmHg): 36.7% diabetes rate
High-normal BP (80-100 mmHg): 28.6% diabetes rate
Normal BP (<80 mmHg): 30.8% diabetes rate
Surprising insight: Even patients with normal BP show substantial diabetes risk, suggesting other factors play crucial roles

4. BMI Categories Tell a Complex Story
Contrary to expectations, the BMI analysis reveals nuanced patterns:
Obese patients: 31.7% diabetes rate (expected high risk)
Normal weight: 6.4% diabetes rate (surprisingly low)
Overweight: 18.3% diabetes rate (moderate risk)
Underweight: 11.8% diabetes rate (unexpected risk presence)

Key Insight: While obesity increases risk, normal-weight individuals aren't immune, and underweight patients show concerning diabetes rates.

5. Diabetes Risk Distribution
The risk categorization shows:
Low risk (35.7%): 274 patients
Medium risk (25.7%): 197 patients
High risk (38.7%): 297 patients

Nearly 65% of patients fall into medium-to-high risk categories, indicating a high-risk population.
